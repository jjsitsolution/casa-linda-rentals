*changes on how we view items with icons on each sections
*the design retains the clean and easy to read text contents maximizing artistic images on the background

*changes on how we view items with icons on each sections
*the design put more representation of water color design by attaching baground on each text content
*it is nice to have those backgroun on content, my only worry for this design concept is that, we might overdo the theme of the site, 
*as much as we want, the user needs to focus reading on contents.
*we have done much enough of the background effects
